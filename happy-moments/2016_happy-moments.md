Tracking happy moments every day just as a practice for gratitude and positivity. At the end of each year I'll have 365 happy moments to look back to :)

[Una](https://twitter.com/una), whom I met during the Chrome Dev Summit in 2015 has been [tracking her goals](https://github.com/una/personal-goals) for quite some time now and inspired by her - I finally decided to give it a shot :)
Other than that - yesterday I gave my first ever talk to college students at [Brandeis University](https://apply.gps.brandeis.edu/register/software-engineering-webinar) about becoming a better software developer and the video was up today.

It was quite a lot of work than I anticipated, but was quite fulfilling to hear that the students found it very valuable. So, there's my 1st happy moment.
There's definitely more to improve on with my presentation skills - but happy for how it went considering it's my first big talk :) Need to rehearse more next time.
