Well, today is the first day of me tracking my happy moments every day - just as a practice in gratitude and positivity.
[Una](https://twitter.com/una) whom I met during the Chrome Dev Summit in 2015 has been [tracking her goals](https://github.com/una/personal-goals) for quite some time now and I finally decided to give it a shot :)
Other than that - yesterday I gave my first ever talk to college students about being a better developer and the video was up today.
It was quite a lot of work than I anticipated, but was quite fulfilling to hear that the students found it very valuable. So, there's my 1st happy moment.
Definitely, there's more to improve on wih my presentation skills - but happy for how it went considering it's my first big talk :) Need to rehearse it next time.
