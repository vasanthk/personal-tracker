Tracking happy moments every day just as a practice for gratitude and positivity. At the end of each year I'll have 365 happy moments to look back to :)

[Una](https://twitter.com/una), whom I met during the Chrome Dev Summit in 2015 has been [tracking her goals](https://github.com/una/personal-goals) for quite some time now and inspired by her - I finally decided to give it a shot :)
Other than that - yesterday I gave my first ever talk to college students at [Brandeis University](https://apply.gps.brandeis.edu/register/software-engineering-webinar) about becoming a better software developer and the video was up today.

It was quite a lot of work than I anticipated, but was quite fulfilling to hear that the students found it very valuable. So, there's my 1st happy moment.
There's definitely more to improve on with my presentation skills - but happy for how it went considering it's my first big talk :) Need to rehearse more next time.

Attended the "Snatch" crossfit seminar at NC Fit - followed by practice of progressions. Snatch is still one of the hardest compound movements in crossfit for me. Was good to get some guidance on its technique. Felt good to get some weights up overhead after a while.

Watched the movie [Arrival](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2543164/) with a few friends. Was quite blown away by how artisitic the movie was. Each of us had a different interpretation for scenes in the movie, which the beauty of any piece of art. Quite an inspiring message as well. I fell sick today and this movie was quite a refreshing break from just lying down in the bed hoping to get fine soon.

Quite often I remind myself to let go of the fear of insecurity while learning or trying out new things. Today I watched this talk on ["The myth of the “Real JavaScript Developer”"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xt5qpbiqw2g) by [Brenna O'Brien](https://twitter.com/brnnbrn) and it was a good reaffirmation to some of my beliefs. Other than this still sick :mask:

Still sick, but went to work and it was a pretty hectic day. My routine is off and everything did seem a bit disrupted. But this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UctRZ91m9XA) of a hysterical kid laughing just reminded me that life is more abou the happy moments than the tough times which keep coming and going. "Keep smiling and laughing even during tough times" I reminded myself :)

Caught up with Planet Earth 2 - Episode 2 on Mountains and life in extreme conditions. It's quite fascinating. Reminded me that survuval instinct is probably the most powerful thing around. It's quite amazing to see how life survived in some of the harshest conditions (Himalayan Ibex), penguins in a volcanic mountain and how bobcats prey even in harshest of ice caps. Really amazing!

Chill day -- Had a team lunch with my manager. Had a pretty good conversation about the next gen of tech and why progressive web apps could be a thing we should bet on. I love such intense technology driven conversations were we just simply nerd out :) Later in the day my manager and another colleague kind of schooled me on financial saving options etc. I am real noob at it. It was really great to get some solid inputs and advise from such experienced folks :)

Watched Dr. Strange - A good treat for the eye and mind. I pretty much seem to get inspired by most movies these days... Haha. They all have an essense beyond all the jazz and entertainment. Something very fundamnetal and dealing with the power of human spirit and things which man can achieve if they put their mind and body to it. Of course super human movies are different - but the point is the same :)

Pretty mellow day. Still recovering from sickness. Geeked out a bit reading up a lot on JavaScripty topics plus reading Brian Holt's complete intro to React - just as a refresher. Also, Jest's snapsh0t testing is pretty cool :)

**11/20/2016**

Watched Planet Earth - Forests episode. Yet another classic! Started reading a bit of the book "Crucial Conversations". Effective communication is one of the much needed skill I want to become highly effective in and tap into.

Today's a big day for Chess fans. Magnus Carlsen the reigning world champion lost his first game after 7 draws in his match against Karjakin for the title. Magnus is clearly the better player on paper, but kudos to Karjakin for handling pressure really well all along and just hanging in there. Sometimes, all it takes is to weather the storm and just hang in there for a little bit longer. It will be really interesting to see how Magnus handles presssure now with just 4 games left. We can expect quite a few fireworks in the games to comes. As a chess fan I can't be more excited :smiley:
