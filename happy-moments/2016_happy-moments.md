Tracking happy moments every day just as a practice for gratitude and positivity. At the end of each year I'll have 365 happy moments to look back to :)

[Una](https://twitter.com/una), whom I met during the Chrome Dev Summit in 2015 has been [tracking her goals](https://github.com/una/personal-goals) for quite some time now and inspired by her - I finally decided to give it a shot :)
Other than that - yesterday I gave my first ever talk to college students at [Brandeis University](https://apply.gps.brandeis.edu/register/software-engineering-webinar) about becoming a better software developer and the video was up today.

It was quite a lot of work than I anticipated, but was quite fulfilling to hear that the students found it very valuable. So, there's my 1st happy moment.
There's definitely more to improve on with my presentation skills - but happy for how it went considering it's my first big talk :) Need to rehearse more next time.

Attended the "Snatch" crossfit seminar at NC Fit - followed by practice of progressions. Snatch is still one of the hardest compound movements in crossfit for me. Was good to get some guidance on its technique. Felt good to get some weights up overhead after a while.

Watched the movie [Arrival](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2543164/) with a few friends. Was quite blown away by how artisitic the movie was. Each of us had a different interpretation for scenes in the movie, which the beauty of any piece of art. Quite an inspiring message as well. I fell sick today and this movie was quite a refreshing break from just lying down in the bed hoping to get fine soon.

Quite often I remind myself to let go of the fear of insecurity while learning or trying out new things. Today I watched this talk on ["The myth of the “Real JavaScript Developer”"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xt5qpbiqw2g) by [Brenna O'Brien](https://twitter.com/brnnbrn) and it was a good reaffirmation to some of my beliefs. Other than this still sick :mask:

Still sick, but went to work and it was a pretty hectic day. My routine is off and everything did seem a bit disrupted. But this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UctRZ91m9XA) of a hysterical kid laughing just reminded me that life is more abou the happy moments than the tough times which keep coming and going. "Keep smiling and laughing even during tough times" I reminded myself :)

Caught up with Planet Earth 2 - Episode 2 on Mountains and life in extreme conditions. It's quite fascinating. Reminded me that survuval instinct is probably the most powerful thing around. It's quite amazing to see how life survived in some of the harshest conditions (Himalayan Ibex), penguins in a volcanic mountain and how bobcats prey even in harshest of ice caps. Really amazing!

Chill day -- Had a team lunch with my manager. Had a pretty good conversation about the next gen of tech and why progressive web apps could be a thing we should bet on. I love such intense technology driven conversations were we just simply nerd out :) Later in the day my manager and another colleague kind of schooled me on financial saving options etc. I am real noob at it. It was really great to get some solid inputs and advise from such experienced folks :)
